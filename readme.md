# vytux_cousins Readme

Released: November 2013

<a name="Description"></a>

## Description

After the decision of the original author of the simpl_cousins author to not support webtrees version 1.5 I have ported some of these modules to this version of webtrees.

This module creates an additional tab in Individual view which list all of the first cousins of that person.

## Requirements

This module requires **webtrees** version 1.5.2 or later.

<a name="Installation"></a>

## Installation

This section documents installation instructions for vytux_cousins.

1.  Unzip the files and upload them to the **webtrees** /modules_v<font color="red">X</font>/ folder on your web server. (Note: "<font color="red">X</font>" = "3" for webtrees versions 1.5 up to 2.0. webtrees 2.0 will be "4" at the time of writing this, but may change in future releases)
2.  Login to **webtrees** as administrator, go to <span class="pointer">Administration --> Modules</span>, and find the module. It will be called "Cousins". Check it has a tick for "Enabled"
3.  Next go to the "Tabs" menu. Set the access level and position for the menu item to suit your preference. It will probably have defaulted to "Show only to managers".
4.  Finally click SAVE, to complete the installation.
